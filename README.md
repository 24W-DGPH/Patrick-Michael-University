This is my work and submission for the Digital Health module final.

"stats_doc_202412.xlsm" -> This is the raw data file. This is the input for my script.

"my_project.xlsx" -> This is an output for the first cleaning round. It is redundant.

"doctor_summary.xlsx" -> This is the final output after all the cleaning and data manipulation. It can be used as a visualization aid despite lacking aesthetics.

https://patrickmichael.shinyapps.io/Patrick-Michael-University/     -> This is the URL that leads to my interactive visuals. 

To recreate my project, only the "app.R" script, "stats_doc_202412.xlsm" database, and the "Patrick-Michael-University.Rproj" project files are needed for download.

Everything else is either redundant or extra outputs
